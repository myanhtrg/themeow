                <p class="Caption">I set up many many alarms a day to wake me up because I always stay up late at nights for works (like 5-6AM late) so I kinda got immuned to alarm sounds lol. I check canvas every opening of the day as well as every end of the day for homeworks and announcements. Although I do s everyday, I still haven’t got used to it and got panic attack everytime I see the volume of works need to be done for the day.

                <p class="Caption">I play with my cat everyday everytime, I cannot stand looking at him without petting him and you can also see “The Meow” is having Batman as the main character and my life is his villain. I use this app to desperately try to understand his meow meow. I actually thought that my cat Batman is the ugliest cat already until I see this cat on reddit drawn by his owner. And yes I surf reddit everyday too mostly for product review and item price and rarity review. Nowhere else’s review is more reliable than reddit yeah?</p>

                <p class="Caption">I also check time at my hometown everyday when I wanted to give them a call. My hometown is in Vietnam which is very far from the US, time in Vietnam is 13 hours ahead from the US. I like playing games and recently I just found a very interesting game where you can complete tasks in real life for stars and money in game to raise your pet penguin and buy her/him clothes and interesting stuff. You can also add friends and there are NPCs and events in this game very interesting. Find more about it <a href="https://finchcare.com/">here</a>

                <p class="Caption"> Facebook marketplace has many many cool items with an incredible price where you can buy, trade and resell all kinds of items like collectibles or technology devices. I often surf and try to find good price items to buy and resell like a side hustle. I was scrolling through instagram stories and then saw a pic of my friend posting the city after typhoon Yagi which is the most powerful typhoon in many many years till now in Asia where Vietnam got affected when the typhoon was at its peak, my city became a complete mess.

I also check gmail everyday for work and school related mails (and desperately waiting for 1 internship offer received out of nearly 200 applications I sent out during the summer). But yeah, checking emails is important you guys, what if I actually win 100k$ CA Lottery and miss it into the spam folder…</p>
